# Redact-Excel

This short program has the ability to redact or change fields unlimited excel spreadsheets in one run. First you indicate which directory has the excel files you wish to alter, then you either can indicate two key-pair columns for replacing the values, build your own key-pair list, or indicate a single value you wish to use as your redactor based on a column. The program then creates the new, seperate excel files in a location of your choosing.

From what I can tell, there is not a readily accessible program online that works relatively similar to this.

The current version is not polished, however still effectively functions as described above. This program uses pandas.
